<title> ****** 20-Nov-2018: MOVIE and SHOWS are now working again. It may take up to 2 minutes to start finding providers the first time you select a movie, but after that it will be much faster. | ******* Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | Current version number is 18.11.20. | To check what version you currently are on, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie, try pausing the movie for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play. ******** </title>
