<title> ****** AV Edge SE current version 19.3.7. Last update was 1-Apr-2019 ****** | 1-Apr-2019: The URL or the LIVE TV channels has been fixed. Please run the AV Edge SE Updater to install the fix. | For Movies and TV Shows, the BLUE server links are not currently working. Once you select the movie or TV show episode and the links come up, just scroll down past the BLUE links to the WHITE links and choose from there. One of those links will work. | [[Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie or TV show, try pausing for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play.]] </title>
