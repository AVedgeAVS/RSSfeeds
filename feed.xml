<title> ****** Current version 20.3.3 | 3-Mar-2020: There's a new AVEdge SE. We fixed the YouTube not loading problem. Now you can enjoy all the music videos again. | If you haven't tried PLEX yet, check it out. There's lots of movies and TV shows to stream. Note: The PLEX account is shared with other AV Edge SE users. | Weâ€™ve moved the APPS menu to the submenu of SYSTEM. So, you can still find all the loaded video addons in the SYSTEM submenu. | Enjoy the new AV Edge SE update! | {{Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SETTINGS then scroll down to Services and click on it. The version is listed in Device name.| Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie or TV show, try pausing for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play.}} </title>
