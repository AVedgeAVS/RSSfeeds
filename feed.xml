<title> ****** Current version 19.4.12. Last update was 12-Apr-2019 ****** | 24-Apr-2019:  The AV Edge HUB and AV Edge SE Updater apps are currently down. This means users are not able to update these apps at present. We are working on the issue and hope to have it back up as soon possible. | {{Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie or TV show, try pausing for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play.}} </title>
