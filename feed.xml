<title> New version of AVEdge SE… version 18.10.19!! If you have not already done so, run the AVEdge Updater SE app to install. | We’ve completely redesigned the user interface for SE Player. The Main menu was changed with the goal of making it easier to use and to have a cleaner look. | Content remains the same in this update. But we will be making some changes in a future version for more live TV and to add lots more streaming content. | ******* Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version you currently are on, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | The current version is v18.10.19. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie, try pausing the movie for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play. ******** </title>
