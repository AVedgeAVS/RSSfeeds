<title> ****** 26-Nov-2018: There's a new version of AV Edge SE. | CBC network addon is currently down. | MOVIE and SHOWS are now working again. You can also use Neptune Rising and Yoda, both are working very well. | ******* Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | Current version number is 18.11.26. | To check what version you currently are on, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie, try pausing the movie for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play. ******** </title>
