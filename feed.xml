<title> ****** 24-Jan-2019: Current version number is 19.1.24. Last update was 24-Jan-2019 | The LIVE menu channels are back up and running. If you are receiving the error Update your URL, you need to update your version of AV Edge. | We are in the process of improving the MOVIES and SHOWS section. EXODUS is currently the default add-on for MOVIES and SHOWS. | You can find several more add-ons for movies and TV shows by going to APPS. Try YODA which looks and feels the same as EXODUS. Or try some of the all-in-one add-ons such as WOLFPACK or MAVERICK or SUPREMACY. | ******* Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie or Tv show, try pausing for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play. ******** </title>
