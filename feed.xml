<title>*** Hey AVEdge HUB and SE users, if you haven't updated your app as yet, do it now. It will fix the MOVIES and SHOWS sections. And we've changed the ADULT section as well. Newest version is v18.4.25. *** Rising Tide has updated, and the Canadian content is back. Go to the LIVE section and check it out. ***</title>
