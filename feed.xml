<title> ****** Current version 20.2.18. | 27-Feb-2020: Fixed LIVE on the main menu not loading | PLEX Movies and TV Shows has been added to the main menu. There’s lots of movies and TV shows to stream. The PLEX account is shared with other AV Edge SE users. | We’ve moved the APPS menu to the submenu of SYSTEM. So, you can still find all the loaded video addons in the SYSTEM submenu. | Enjoy the new AV Edge SE update! | {{Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SETTINGS then scroll down to Services and click on it. The version is listed in Device name.| Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie or TV show, try pausing for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play.}} </title>
