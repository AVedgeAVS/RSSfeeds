<title> ****** 19-Nov-2018: MOVIE and SHOWS are currently down. However, you can go to APPS and select the Addon YODA to find movies and TV shows. There will be an update to fix the MOVIES and SHOWS soon. | ******* Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version you currently are on, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie, try pausing the movie for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play. ******** </title>
