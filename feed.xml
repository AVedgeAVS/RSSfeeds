<title> ****** 30-Nov-2018: Current version number is 18.11.27. Last update was 27-Nov-2018| We switched MOVIES and SHOWS to Neptune Rising and we added the Yoda addon to the submenu.  You can still access Exodus through the APPS menu | The LIVE menu channels are currently not available on the LIVE menu. You can find them by going to the  APPS menu and using the addon MKcanlive, then clicking Mixed TV 1. The live channels will be back on LIVE in the next update. | ******* Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version you currently are on, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie, try pausing the movie for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play. ******** </title>
