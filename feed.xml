<title> ****** Current version 19.10.26. Last update was 26-Oct-2019 ****** | There's an update to AV Edge SE. We've fixed Einthusan nd added Plex to MOVIES and TV SHOWS. We also added the Deceit addon to APPS. | {{Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie or TV show, try pausing for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play.}} </title>
