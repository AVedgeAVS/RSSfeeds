<title> ****** 12-Dec-2018: Current version number is 18.12.5. Last update was 5-Dec-2018 | If you click on a movie or TV show in EXODUS and it doesn't start searching providers right away, give it some time. It gets better the more you use it. Also, if you get No Stream Available with the RD providers (the blue ones), try selecting one of the non-RD providers.| If you like YODA for movies and Tv shows, it is available in MOVIES and SHOWS. Try the All-in-one addons found in APPS. There's lots of great content to be found there. | The LIVE menu channels are back up and running. | ******* Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie, try pausing the movie for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play. ******** </title>
