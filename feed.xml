<title> ****** New version 20.5.24. | 24-May-2020: There is a new version of the AV Edge HUB build. | We have switched MOVIES and SHOWS to the EXODUS addon. Neptune remains in the menu. It does work intermittently. | PLEX Movies and TV Shows has been moved to the top of the main menu. There is lots of movies and TV shows to stream PLEX. The PLEX account is shared with other AV Edge HUB users. | Einthusan is currently not working. | Enjoy the new AV Edge HUB update! | {{Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SETTINGS then scroll down to Services and click on it. The version is listed in Device name.| Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie or TV show, try pausing for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play.}} </title>
