<title> New version of AVEdge SE… version 18.9.15!! Run the AVEdge Updater SE app to install. | We’ve made changes to improve the live TV and replaced some sub-menu items. | LIVE will no longer load the channels at startup but will now use the direct up to date Fluxus IPTV links. | In the LIVE submenu we have replaced Man Cave with two new items Lodge IPTV and ATF Live TV, both offering US and UK channels plus sports. | Also in LIVE, the CBC Network now covers the full CBC network of channels including the CBC National News channel. | In MOVIES check out the ATF Movie Direct Links for lots of up to date movies without the need to pick the server to stream the movie. This is much easier to use. | ******* Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version you currently are on, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | The current version is v18.9.15. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie, try pausing the movie for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play. ******** </title>
