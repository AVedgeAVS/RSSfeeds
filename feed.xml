<title> ****** New version 20.4.11. | 11-Apr-2020: We’ve got a new version of the AV Edge SE build. | We’ve switched MOVIES and SHOWS to the EXODUS addon. Neptune remains in the menu. It does work intermittently. | PLEX Movies and TV Shows has been moved to the top of the main menu. There’s lots of movies and TV shows to stream. The PLEX account is shared with other AV Edge SE users. | Einthusan has been fixed. You should find all your Indian movies working now. | Enjoy the new AV Edge SE update! | {{Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version is currently installed, click SETTINGS then scroll down to Services and click on it. The version is listed in Device name.| Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie or TV show, try pausing for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play.}} </title>
