Last update was 5-Dec-2018| We switched MOVIES and SHOWS to EXODUS | The LIVE menu channels are back up and running. | ******* Always use the latest version of the AV Edge app. | To check what version you currently are on, click SYSTEM and look for the version number in the bottom right corner of the screen. It starts with 99. | Remember, if you experience sticking when streaming a movie, try pausing the movie for a minute or 2 at the beginning to allow it to build enough buffer, then click play. ******** </title>
